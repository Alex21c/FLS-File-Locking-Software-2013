Project Title :  “File Locking Software”

Development Year: 2013

Abstract :\
File Locking Software is a  kind of utility software  used for protecting the confidential files by the Authenticated User (User who has installed the File Locking Software) to protect his/her files from unauthorized access or modification by other Users on the same PC.

PROJECT INTRODUCTION

Concept Of Files\
		An operating system (OS) is a collection of software’s that manages hardware resources and provides common services for computer.  Application programs require an operating system to function. The one of the Major function performed by the OS is Files Management. It is responsible for the creation, updation, and deletion of files. Files are the one which stored variety of data like they can be used to stores music, images, movies, documents, lists, games and programs etc.

Why File Locking Software?\
		I would like to answer this question by taking an Example.
Example:\
	Let I take the case of Windows 7 (OS Developed by the Microsoft). Let I have installed Windows 7 in my PC. And there are three User accounts created. Let I have some Personal files in my Hard Disk Drive (HDD) which I do not want to share with the other two accounts. But the owners of these two accounts are capable of accessing my Personal files which is not fair. Windows 7 also provide the way to secure these files by setting Credentials. But here are some limitation/Difficulties which may be faced by using Windows Security Credentials.

Limitations of Windows Security Credentials:
1. Unfamiliar Command Line Support for Novice Users \
	Windows supports command line credentials support using cacls & icalcs commands that runs in MS-DOS. The user who is not too much familiar with the MS-DOS may faces lot of problems and also these commands are little bit difficult to understand and apply. These command are generally used by the Intermediate & Advanced Windows Users.
2. GUI Support Complications \
	Windows also provide the GUI (Graphical User Interface) support to the user. User can also set Security Credential for files and folder by going to their properties and then on the security tab just settings the credentials. But this method is also little bit complicated and user may suffer the loss of data and other problems too like Inheritable Permissions and Auditing (Enhanced Security Concept).  
3. Lack of Records of Secured Files\
	Also if someone got success to apply these windows credentials then there is another problem with these methods. Windows does not provide you the list or any Record of files Locked by the User. It may become major problem like the case where in one’s PC there are thousands of files stored and user locked let 200 files stored at different- different locations. Now user wants to unlock any 45 files. Now to do so User has to traverse through all the thousands of files and search for those 45 files which he/she intends to unlock. This would be too much Time Consuming and Frustrating.
4. Complex\
	Setting Security Credentials can be Complex, Non-User Friendly and Problem Causing in some cases. Like command line support in MS-DOS is complex and problems of Inheritance and Auditing (Enhanced Security Concept) in GUI Support.
5. Easily Hackable by Other Admins.\
	Unauthorized access to Private Data One can change the Access Credentials using Administrative Privileges and thus result in unauthorized access to Private Data. Even the Standard Users who know the Admin password can also access the data by changing the security Credentials.

Supreme features of File Locking Software are as follows:
1.	File Locking Software is Fully Supported with Encryption, Windows Security Credentials, Windows Cacls as well as Login Password.

2.	The whole File Locking Software is truly GUI application and too Much User Friendly as Compares to the Windows Security Credentials GUI.

3.	The Lockers Created by File Locking Software have following features :
-	Inaccessible
-	Undeletable
-	Unmovable
-	Un-renameable
-	Do the same functionality as the locker style is chosen. 
For e.g.:
-	If locker style is set to the My Computer then when anyone will try to open the Locker it will automatically open the Computer rather than opening the Locker.

-	The size of the locker is always shown 0 Bytes. Even if Locker Size is Greater than of Tera Bytes.

-	The lockers are almost Unhackable. If anyone succeeded in opening the locker then he/she will not be able to read the files stored inside that locker because of Encryption. In simple words files stored inside the Lockers are always Corrupted.

4.	Require Authentication (Username and Password) during Uninstallation as well.

5.	Provide Facility of Restoring Files as well as Extract Files from the Lockers.

6.	Allow Authenticated Users to Modify Lockers (Rename, Delete, Change Style & Path etc.)

7.	Prevent User to Install File Locking Software over an Existing File Locking Software (Hacking Prevention Technique).

8.	Prevent Standard Users to Being Install File Locking Software. Only those users can install and Use this application that possesses Administrative Privileges.

9.	Password Change & Password Reset Options are Embedded in case user Want to Set New Username and Password or forgot Username and Password.

10.	Open Source.
